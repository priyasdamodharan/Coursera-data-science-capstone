Coursera Data Science Capstone

This repository contains the relevant files used and created during the Data Science Capstone Project.

The purpose of the project was to develop a data product which uses natural language processing to predict the next word a user may want to type. A shiny application serves as the final product for this project.


#Final Project Submission

The goal for this final project assignment is to implement a learning model for text prediction. Using the text prediction algorithm, create a product in Shiny that provides a user interface that can be accessed by users.

This repository contains the ui.R and server.R source code files for the developed Shiny application as well as the RStudio Presenter files.

The Shiny application is hosted on shinyapps.io and the Presentation (slides) are available on RPubs.
